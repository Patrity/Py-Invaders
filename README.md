# Py Invaders
 This project was created as my first learning experience with Python.\
 It is a recreation with some tweaks of the classic game, "Space Invaders"\
 The game features a full highscores system as well that is written in Java using the Spring Library\

 ##Controls:
 WASD/Arrow Keys for movement\
 Space to shoot\
 1, 2, 3 to change firing mode
 
 ####Rules
 Players start with 5 lives. Every time a player receives damage from an enemy projectile or an enemy ship, a player loses 1 life.\
 When a player successfully dodges an enemy projetile, 10 points are awarded.\
 When a player destroys an enemy ship, 100 points are awarded.
 If an enemy ship reaches the bottom of the screen, a life is lost and 50 points are deducted.
 
 ##TODO:
 * Sprite swap for player and enemy death
 * Add a pause with a 3 second immunity after the player takes damage
